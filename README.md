# Circuit_Theory_Circuits
This repository contains my lab files for Circuit Theory circuits. The files include circuit diagrams, simulations, and analysis results that were created as part of my coursework.

Each lab file corresponds to a specific Circuit Theory circuit, and includes a brief description of the circuit's function, design, and analysis. The files are organized by lab session and cover a range of topics, including network theorems, transient analysis, and frequency response.

Overall, these lab files provide a comprehensive introduction to Circuit Theory and demonstrate its use in practical applications. They are suitable for students and hobbyists interested in electrical engineering and circuit analysis.
